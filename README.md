# GardenDAO Forks Wallet Server Side and API Intro

This is documentation of the server-side Forks Wallet system, including its API.

The server will be implemented initially in Python using the light API-friendly framework fastapi (https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi).

Private keys and seed words are created in the local client, e.g. mobile app or browser extension, and must never be transmitted to or generated by the server.

Blockchain ID: We use the ticker symbol string of characters in lowercase as a blockchain ID, for easy readability. Ref: https://alltheblocks.net/

TODO: API versioning approach, using fastapi?

possible Forks Wallet Server API servicing domain name: api.forkswallet.gardendao.org


## Install

Requires redis, e.g. sudo apt-get install redis

```
git clone https://github.com/GardenDAO/forks-wallet-server-api
# change config.py

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn openapi:app --host 0.0.0.0
```


## dev
Requires Python 3.7+ (due to chia-blockchain package)

c. Run python3 -m venv venv to create a virtual environment.

d. Run . ./venv/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment.

e. Run pip install -r requirements.txt  This may take a few minutes.

uvicorn openapi:app --reload

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

NOTE that API endpoints start with a version prefix, e.g. "/v1"
e.g. /v1/blockchain/xch/address/xch175hfws7whwsym5sstm2pkmmav42tf8vnk23pa703nkyyaj6mn7rqrssep7/balance

### Response Format

JSON, request & response format, similar approach to Kraken exchange Rest API replies, https://docs.kraken.com/rest/

Response data is in "result". If there were errors in processing request, details are in "errors"

Output listed below will be inside the "result" object.


### Get Balance

URI: /v1/blockchain/blockchain_ID/address/address_ID/balance

Get current balance of a wallet address

    Input
    address_ID: wallet address
    blockchain_ID: blockchain's ticker symbol, e.g. "xch", lowercase
    [ possible future expansion: token list? (optional): default is primary token of the blockchain ]

    Output
      balance: balance of the address on the requested blockchain, amount in integer in unit of lowest denomination of the token, e.g. mojos for xch/chia


### Send Transaction (POST)

URI - POST: /v1/blockchain/blockchain_ID/send

Receive Transaction from client, log as appropriate, submit to the appropriate blockchain network, and return a response code.

    Input
    tx: Transaction Bundle, in the POST body
    blockchain_ID - which blockchain to submit the transaction to, ticker symbol, e.g. "xch", lowercase

    Output
    status: response from full node client
    id: id if available/relevant
    [TBD maybe in future: info: Some blockchain information, like transaction id; error code if error encountered, need to review standard api approach on this quickly again]


### Get Transactions

URI - POST: /v1/blockchain/blockchain_ID/address/address_ID/transactions

For a given wallet address on a given blockchain, get all transactions

    Input
    address_ID: wallet address
    blockchain_ID: blockchain's ticker symbol, e.g. "xch", lowercase

    [ NOT IMPLEMENTED startdate: Start date of the query, unix timestamp milliseconds (or by block number??)   enddate: End date of the query, unix timestamp milliseconds]

    Output
    transactions: each with these properties:
      type: 'receive' or 'send' (receive implemented first)
      transactions: [],
      timestamp: row.timestamp,
      block: row.confirmed_block_index,
      amount: row.coin.amount,
      fee: row.coin.amount, # TODO this looks wrong


[ GetBalances - possibly later]

Get current balance of a list of  wallet addresses

    Input
    addresses: list of wallet addresses
    blockchainID: which blockchain
    [ future expansion: token list (optional): default is primary token of the blockchain ]
    Output
    blockchainID
    balance: dictionary list of balances requested with amounts in integer of lowest denomination of the token, e.g. mojos for XCH { ‚ÄúXCH‚Äù: 1000 }
    Rate Limiting
    TBD: at some point look at if rate limiting needs to be looked at

## Adding Support For New Blockchains

TBD: These are the steps for adding support for an additional blockchain / chia fork

    create enum value for Blockchain ID
    integration of api calls to the blockchain‚Äôs software
    integration testing
